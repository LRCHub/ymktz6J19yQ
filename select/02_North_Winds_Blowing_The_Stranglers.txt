I saw an orange robe burning
I saw a youth on fire
I saw metal machines that were turning
On a generation that hadn't yet tired

I heard of two generations being murdered
In a Europe that was shrouded in black
I witnessed the birth pains of new nations
When the chosen people finally went back

North Winds Blowing
I wish it would blow all away
North Winds Blowing
I wish they would blow all away
I wish they would blow all away

I saw freedom in the shape of disease
And mainly men had to quench their desire
And while a few could do just as they pleased
I saw kids whose bellies were all on fire

When all is dead and war is over
When hollow victory has been won
Who will join in the celebration
Of the evil that just can't be undone?

North Winds Blowing
I wish it would blow all away
North Winds Blowing
I wish they would blow all away
I wish they would blow all away

I used to dream about destruction
But now that I feel it getting near
I spend my time watching the ocean
And waves are all I want to hear

I wish I was a believer
I'd spend less time in being sad
So many laws against disbelieving
Don't know who's good or who's bad

North Winds Blowing
North Winds Blowing
North Winds Blowing
North Winds Blowing
