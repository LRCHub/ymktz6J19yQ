Many's the time I've sat here alone with you
Two flowers in a field could not be sweeter
Nor breezes up high in the blue

Higher than you, faintly blowing
Higher than you, faintly blowing
Higher than you, faintly blowing

Time and again we have not said a word, just looked
Two tumbling stones on a beach in the surf
Living on rainbows, we are hooked

Rainbows faintly blowing
Rainbows faintly blowing
Rainbows faintly blowing

See the children touch their tiny hands
Unto the sun
Unto the sun
Unto the sun

Now and then, we just lay here together and smile
Two pieces of grass in an acre of corn
Happy and free for a while

Freely faintly blowing
Freely faintly blowing
Freely faintly blowing
Blowing, faintly blowing
Blowing, faintly blowing
Unto the sun
Unto the sun
Unto the sun

Ad lib
