Blowing Away
The Fifth Dimension

- (#21 in 1970)

You ole fire, I'm mad with desire,
You're my favorite one.
You got me cookin' with the fever,
Got me runnin' for the sun.
Uh-huh, runnin' for the sun,
I feel so high, I feel like I may
Go blowin' away (go blowin' away) blowin' away.
Blow, blow, blowin' away (blow, blow, blowin' away).

My well meaner, my day fancy dreamer
Oh, what can it be?
Well, it's something like a power,
Like a hold, and it's holdin' me.
Uh-huh, and it's holdin' me,
I feel so high, I feel like I may
Go blowin' away (blowin' away) blowin' away.
Blow, blow, blowin' away (blow, blow, blowin' away)
Blow, blow, blowin' away.

My long laster, my soft-hearted master
Ain't been born and bred.
But he's standin' in my doorway in my mind
Up above my, up above, up above my head,
Up above my head, up above my head,
I feel so high, I feel like I may
Go blowin' away, blowin' away, (blowin' away)
Blowin' away, blowin' away, blowin' away
Blow, blow, blowin' away, (blowin' away, blow, blow,
Blowin away, blow, blow, blowin' away), blowin' away,
Blow, blow, blowin' away, blow, blow, blowin' away,
Blow, blow, blowin' away. . . .
